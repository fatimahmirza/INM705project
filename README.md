# Real Time Object Detection: A comparative Analysis Of YOLOv1 And ResNet50 Archtectures
## Overview
The content of this repository related to the coursework of INM705. This readme file provides the detailed instruction on how to set-up and training procedure for the baseline model and also for the improved model. An implementation of "yolov1" for baseline and "ResNet50" for advanced model for object detection. Pytorch is served as a programming language for this project.
## Dataset 
After preprocessing,I split the data into train and test folders.
